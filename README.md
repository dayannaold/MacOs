Hello, everybody.
I'm actually starting to put in practic some class and lessons I've learning in programming language and putting in my first practical in code.
I was really excited to learn code just like many people, we get too much excitment and starts from the wrong way. Now, finally I think I'm finding my self and learning deeeply how to code with differents methodologies, I've been stuyding from mimo, DIO website, Learning code with Morsh and now this project is based at free class on Youtube with Gustavo Guanabara. My display machine that I used to work just broke and it's Windows system operacional but still wortking well besides the fact I cannot carry to anywhere as before, that's mean I'm just able to work in my bedroom (when I have a time) to study and I got a new Macbook to learn, so I'm fixing my learning in different operacional system.

I hope I can learn this and see in the future how much I have grown in this time. 

Thank you Janet, Gui and Suzy for supporting me.
